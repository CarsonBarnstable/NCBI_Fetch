# V1
### Notes:
- This version was developed as-needed for on-demand file processing (and therefore is not as modular, flexible, or clean as I would prefer)
- These files were all created while trying to obtain/parse/handle the same research data, but are not all configured to work together by default
- Once a V2 version is developed, this version should not be used (likely slower, less flexible/configurable, and out of date
