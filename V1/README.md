# V1
### Notes:
- This version was developed as-needed for on-demand file processing (and therefore is not as modular, flexible, or clean as I would prefer)
- These files were all created while trying to obtain/parse/handle the same research data, but are not all configured to work together by default
- Once a V2 version is developed, this version should not be used (likely slower, less flexible/configurable, and out of date
- Most Data files and Outputs in this repo are truncated for size. Do not use as a resource, but rather as a format/example
### Script Explanations Available in the [Scripts Readme](./Scripts/.)
### General Workflow(s):
- All Files stored in their respective folders
  - Data (Inputs) are files that will be read in to operate on
  - Outputs are files that are generated by programs (best to use as a temp folder)
  - Scripts are programs (and any supporting files) that transform data
