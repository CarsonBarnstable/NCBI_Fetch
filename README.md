# NCBI_Fetch
### A Program to Retrieve, Parse, Organize, and Format NCBI Genome Sequence Information
##### Initially Created for Shashank Pathak and Guohui Lin, PhD of the University of Alberta
#####
## [V1 - Initial Version - Public](https://github.com/CarsonBarnstable/NCBI_Fetch/tree/main/V1)
- Created Summer 2023, this was the first & only version, used for data collection for research purposes
- Worked for specific files & inputs used, but somewhat limited in it's generality
- Didn't work as all one utility (different processes had to be invoked manually to get full end result)
## V2 - Planned Feburary 2024
- To work more generally, from a config file, with more capabilities more generally available
- Cross-platform support (for file paths and naming schemes)
- Possible asynchronus API retrieval or multi-threaded operation (to improve data collection times)
